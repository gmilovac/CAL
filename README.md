# Lab 7: Terrain

## Task 6:
Scaling z, the output of getHeight changes the amplitude of the noise (directly proportional)
Larger number means greater peaks/valleys, since z is the output height it scales the heightmap

Scaling x,y, the inputs of interpolate changes the frequency of the noise (directly proportional)
Scaling x adjusts the frequency in the x direction, increasing it traverses the noise function faster making the frequency higher and likewise with y.
